# January 2015 Developer Interview Project (DRAFT)

If you have found this repository it is likely because you are going through the interview process.  

The purpose of this repository is to allow job candidates the ability to showcase their skills by creating a very simple application based on the specifications outlined here.  

# House Keeping Notes
Please keep these things in mind prior to getting started:

1. Please do not fork this repository to ensure your work cannot easily be copied by other candidates since all forks are easily located.
2. If you are unsure how to proceed with this repository there is a high chance you do not meet the minimum requirments for this job.  
3. If you make it to the next stage of the interview process, you will be asked to provide a 15-20 presenation of your work associated with this project.  Please keep this in mind as you are putting together your solution.
4. We do not want this project to take up too much of your time so we purposfully make it straightforward.  We estimate this project to take between 2-4 hours of time.
5. The project has some code written as a jump start to get things going.  While the code written is functional, we acknowledge that it is not actually production worthy, scalable code.  Please do not completly refactor the existing code to something you feel is more elegant.  At this point we would like to use the base code as the standard for all candidates and see where they take it from here.

#Project Overview
For this project you will be constructing a proxy REST API that calls a mock SmarterMeasure REST API.  At the end of the project you will have completed the following tasks:

* Extending the existing REST API by adding a new call to look up user results.
* Constructed a search interface to find users by email address.
* Created an assessment overview page that output the results of a users assessment.

## Requirements

### Deliverable
The deliverable should be easily installed by following an updated version of this README document in your repository.  To provide a standard place to add your project specific install notes, we have provided a section below titled "Candidate Install".

# Connecting to the SmarterMeasure API
For this project we have created a mock API that mimics the actual SmarterMeasure API.  Here are a few things to note about this API:

* To keep things simple, there is no authentication required.
* All the data that is returned is mock/dummy data.


# Candidate Install
Please edit this section providing any documention required to get your version of the install running.  This should include the following:

* How to install the app.
* How to run the unit tests.
* How to run the server, if different from the default method provided.
